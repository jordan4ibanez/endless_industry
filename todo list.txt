- layers

- ores but baked into the ground via the biome
- trajectory change, making it easier to get a game going.

- Precalculate that stupid `x + basePositionX` in ore generation, DRY please

- sql saving on a green thread to be non blocking

- raygui - translate it to D

- Use the ubuntu font set cause why not

- better tileset
- Find a nice tileset on opengameart

- Link the game's logic to the FPS so that the game's logic can be accelerated with a mod




Later:



- greedy meshing (this will need a fundamental rework on the texture atlas to allow repeating textures)

<

- whichever biome is created first is the default
 - - Make this biome the grasslands

- desert biome

- biomes in the list should be set in order in a fixed list

#! ::::IMPORTANT:::::

= The chunks being loaded is not causing lag!
 The chunks holding so many VAOs in memory is causing a weird thing to happen with OpenGL when going past 30_000 VAOs
 Keep the chunks loaded in memory but unload any chunk's MESH (<<MESH>> NOT THE CHUNK) so it just uses a bunch of memory, not lag!
