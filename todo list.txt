- Build a GUI library in raylib using stock D architectural components

Only one window open at a time

- Use the ubuntu font set cause why not

- at a certain zoom out distance, things go into either solid colors or it goes into a half sized atlas

- better tileset
- Find a nice tileset on opengameart

- Link the game's logic to the FPS so that the game's logic can be accelerated with a mod

- Unload map meshes within a certain distance to save GPU memory


Later:

- sql saving on a green thread to be non blocking

- greedy meshing (this will need a fundamental rework on the texture atlas to allow repeating textures)

<

- whichever biome is created first is the default
 - - Make this biome the grasslands

- desert biome

- biomes in the list should be set in order in a fixed list

#! ::::IMPORTANT:::::

= The chunks being loaded is not causing lag!
 The chunks holding so many VAOs in memory is causing a weird thing to happen with OpenGL when going past 30_000 VAOs
 Keep the chunks loaded in memory but unload any chunk's MESH (<<MESH>> NOT THE CHUNK) so it just uses a bunch of memory, not lag!
